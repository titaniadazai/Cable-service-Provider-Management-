# Cable-TV SERVICE PROVIDER MANAGEMENT(small business book keeping):
The service providers for essential services(milk, cable tv,newspapers on subscription ,monthly subscription vendors,local stores) often use traditional old methods for keeping track of payments such as book keeping and customers use a variety of payment methods(cash, credit, bank transfer, UPI). 
Hence there is a requirement of database management system to reduce redundancies and improve consistency. There is a good amount of business impact ,financial loss and lots of waste in time. This also creates customer dissatisfaction and a bad reputation for the owners. 

To resolve this issue, service providers may consider using apps for a customer base sizing above 2000 households.This would reduce manual labour and provide an efficient and easy management.

Challenges:
Business:
1)Customers must be able to easily use this app.
2)Business owners be okay with the deployment charges.
3)Point 2 in account,customer base should be considerably big for this solution to be effective.

Technology:
NADA for now.
